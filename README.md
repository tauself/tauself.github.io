## Welcome to Mark Rosenberg's page.

The following images and gifs show python output on a variety of topics related to complex numbers.

The primary concept is as follows. The goal is optimization of a system. The system operates by the state transition rules, and at each state a policy maps the state to an action. One step in finding the optimal policy involves integration. The work investigates algorithms for the integration and computing the optimal action given the observations. The optimal policy is completely specified by the given information. The given information is represented by a configuration of finitely many bits organized in a particular way that denotes the meaning of the bits. The optimal policy has a form that is symmetric to this. It can also be represented with a finite number of bits. My research investigates number theory proofs to build computing concepts. For example, the concept of zero is more bulky than the concept of one, because zero is made up from one and its opposite (negative one) in a closed loop. Conventional notation can obscure meaning by using symbols like the negative sign or the imaginary unit. Negative one's earliest emergence seems to be as the simplest concept that solves f(f(x))=x and f(x) != x.

After sufficient exploration of the building blocks, I focused less on proving number theory results, and more on building tools for individuals to make more efficient decisions. Time is a central concept (a relationship between moments of the type 'not' with direction etc.), so I built a display panel with calendar features revolving around a representation of time as a space-filling curve. Among it's many aspects is the idea that the area and shape of events becomes more tangible, and the framework of bits becomes more familiar so that users develop intuition for the nature of decisions. One goal is a personal dashboard so that individuals can have a visual display on their local devices to interact with their beliefs, goals, schedule, and more. The software in turn may shape one's thinking as an external location for cognitive computations. The design of these tools down to the order they were built and even the order of adding lines of code is generally done in a way so that changes to a flowing system are not abrupt.

### Complex Numbers

Visualizing complex functions is a step towards solving intractable integrals, whose analytic solutions can be used for optimization. 

The first image relates to polynomials. The polynomial's degree is the number of Riemann sheets in the domain and the number of non-trivial coefficients. The image represent the coefficients and zeros of the polynomials. By considering the coefficients in the same space as the roots, the coefficients are centroids of n-simplices in a hypercube topology defined by the roots. When the roots are clustered together, the coefficients have an angular component shown on the x-axis close to multiples of the root angles.

## Current Projects:

Created a script that takes a directory path with images and .ics calendar events, and displays them for a specified time interval, placing the photos and events (including recurring) at the timestamp for the corresponding duration. The display is a space-filling curve, which represents moments that are close in time as close in space, so that ends of adjacent weeks or months are not disjoint. Also, the area of the displayed event is directly proportional to the duration.
