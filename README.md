## Welcome to Mark Rosenberg's page.

Below I've included images from projects I've been working on involving complex numbers. Visualizing complex functions is a step towards solving intractable integrals, whose analytic solutions can be used for optimization. 

The first two relate to polynomials. The polynomial's degree is the number of Riemann sheets in the domain and the number of non-trivial coefficients. The images represent the coefficients and zeros of the polynomials. By considering the coefficients in the same space as the roots, the coefficients are centroids of n-simplices in a hypercube topology defined by the roots.

The next image shows a frame from an animation through Taylor approximations of the exponential function, where the approximation order isn't limited to discrete natural numbers.

These images show the behavior of the zeros of a sum of exponentials.

The two images below utilize a Moore curve to represent time for a week and year. The shading for the weekly represents day and night, and the shading for the yearly represents the lunar cycle.

Current Projects:

-Created a functioning script that takes a directory path with images and .ics calendar events, and displays them for a specified time interval, placing the photos and events (including recurring) at the correct timestamp for the correct duration. The display is a Hilbert curve, which represents moments that are close in time as close in space. One benefit is that the end of a week or month is not disjoint from the next moment in time. Another benefit is that the area of the displayed event is directly proportional to the duration, rather than independent lengths for the two axes. This facilitates developing intuition for relative durations of time, by representing time in the same 2-dimensional display where physical objects are observed. In progress is adjustments on the aesthetic design of the display, including parameterizing parts of the space-filling curve. Another goal is to incorporate functions that re-map the colors according to one's visible light range. 

-Created a script to visualize source code or trees in general in a space-filling way. This can facilitate recognizing redundancies, as well as understanding the general topology. One part can aid a user in displaying thoughts hierarchically for task management. In progress is a complete organizational system to facilitate identifying beliefs, evaluating beliefs, aligning beliefs and behavior, generating goals and tasks from beliefs, scheduling tasks on the calendar, and recording memories/observations in the same calendar space.

-Building tools for tracking progress in establishing new routines and changing old ones. Will take the timestamp from photos, resize new photos and insert into the location corresponding to the present, shifting all past photos down, and resizing their dimensions by half accordingly, like memory. Gaps for times in the period (day, week) of the recurring task when no photo was taken shrink as well over time, and a greater percent of the area of the image is taken up by photos of the completed task. Future goals established in a natural way arriving on the display from infinity. The direction of the long-term average will be towards one. Using a finite number of bits to represent the long-term average may result in reaching 100%. Asymptotically, average cases of performance can be used as canonical representations to display results of different pathways.

Future Work:

-A display to represent news, communications, current state, and more, in a hierarchical way, so users can both filter out content beyond their space of control, yet incorporating global summaries. 

-Cryptocurrencies to reward good.

-A dating app.

-Work on hyperoperations, flow, addition of complex numbers, visualizing limit distributions of simulated dynamics, animating and visualizing polynomial roots and coefficients and solving equations given a finite sequence of symbols. 

-Conflict resolution algorithm by selecting juries of peers with the appropriate similarities and differences to facilitate resolution.

-Algorithm to use community values for addressing hate by utilizing semi-public layers of visibility of beliefs and policies.

-Transmission systems with security utilizing community-voted weights for risk, costs, and processes.

-An approach to technological unemployment that acknowledges imperfections in systems. The flow of sunlight through society is subdivided hierarchically, so that specialization in quadrants of a space-filling curve from input to output may be repurposed in a corresponding section of finer granularity. For example if one works in regulation, finer granularity might involve the input to/of/for regulation or regulation of the input sector. Guided by the philosophy that the whole and its parts flourish with each other. Specialization and coordination among parts involves emphasis on a specialty without sacrificing core ability to sustain independent flow/processing. For example, while all parts benefit from balanced specialization, losing entirely the ability to farm or hunt to maintain sustenance corresponds to a society that has entirely automated the basic needs. Perfecting assisted-driving involves a feedback loop with drivers. Since the actions of self-driving vehicles occur over finite time, incremental steps towards automation involve alerting the driver, presenting options, subdividing the time interval to allow the driver to give the vehicle the opportunity to adjust according to the driver's approval, with appropriate time for the driver to override. The order of the sequence of events towards automation matters, and the progress can be tracked and compared to measure improvement. While there is urgency to strive towards perfection, the outcome results from the process, which is embedded with order. To change a simple flow to a more intricate flow, the transition should not involve a step that redirects flow before controlling it.

-Displaying the costs of free things.

-Optimizing natural monopolies.

-Transforming systems with integer states to allow for fractional states to optimize bureaucracy.
