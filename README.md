## Welcome to Mark's page.

Below I've included images from projects I've been working on involving complex numbers. Visualizing complex functions is a step towards solving intractable integrals, whose analytic solutions can be used for optimization. 

The first two show polynomials. The polynomial's degree is the number of Riemann sheets in the domain and the number of non-trivial coefficients. The images represent the coefficients and zeros of the polynomials.

The next image shows a frame from an animation of a Taylor approximation of the exponential function, where the approximation order isn't limited to discrete natural numbers.

This image shows the zeros of a countable sum of exponentials tending towards a line.

The two images below utilize a Moore curve to represent time for a week and year. The shading for the weekly represents day and night, and the shading for the yearly represents the moon phase cycles.

The animations below relate to the exponential function.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/tauself/tauself.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.






### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](url)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/tauself/tauself.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
