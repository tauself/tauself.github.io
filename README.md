## Welcome to Mark Rosenberg's page.

Below I've included images from projects I've been working on involving complex numbers. Visualizing complex functions is a step towards solving intractable integrals, whose analytic solutions can be used for optimization. 

The first two relate to polynomials. The polynomial's degree is the number of Riemann sheets in the domain and the number of non-trivial coefficients. The images represent the coefficients and zeros of the polynomials. By considering the coefficients in the same space as the roots, the coefficients are centroids of n-simplices in a hypercube topology defined by the roots.

The next image shows a frame from an animation through Taylor approximations of the exponential function, where the approximation order isn't limited to discrete natural numbers.

These images show the behavior of the zeros of a sum of exponentials.

The two images below utilize a Moore curve to represent time for a week and year. The shading for the weekly represents day and night, and the shading for the yearly represents the lunar cycle.

The animations below relate to the exponential function.
