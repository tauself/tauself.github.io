## Welcome to Mark Rosenberg's page.

Below I've included images from projects I've been working on involving complex numbers. Visualizing complex functions is a step towards solving intractable integrals, whose analytic solutions can be used for optimization. 

The first two relate to polynomials. The polynomial's degree is the number of Riemann sheets in the domain and the number of non-trivial coefficients. The images represent the coefficients and zeros of the polynomials. By considering the coefficients in the same space as the roots, the coefficients are centroids of n-simplices in a hypercube topology defined by the roots.

The next image shows a frame from an animation through Taylor approximations of the exponential function, where the approximation order isn't limited to discrete natural numbers.

These images show the behavior of the zeros of a sum of exponentials.

The two images below utilize a Moore curve to represent time for a week and year. The shading for the weekly represents day and night, and the shading for the yearly represents the lunar cycle.

The animations below relate to the exponential function.

Current Projects:

-Created a functioning script that takes a directory path with images and .ics calendar events, and displays them for a specified time interval, placing the photos and events (including recurring) at the correct timestamp for the correct duration. The display is a Hilbert curve, which represents moments that are close in time as close in space. One benefit is that the end of a week or month is not disjoint from the next moment in time. Another benefit is that the area of the displayed event is directly proportional to the duration, rather than independent lengths for the two axes. This facilitates developing intuition for relative durations of time, by representing time in the same 2-dimensional display where physical objects are observed. In progress is adjustments on the aesthetic design of the display, including parameterizing parts of the space-filling curve. Another goal is to incorporate functions that re-map the colors according to one's visible light range. 

-Created a script to visualize source code or trees in general in a space-filling way. This can facilitate recognizing redundancies, as well as understanding the general topology. One part can aid a user in displaying thoughts hierarchically for task management. In progress is a complete organizational system to facilitate identifying beliefs, evaluating beliefs, aligning beliefs and behavior, generating goals and tasks from beliefs, scheduling tasks on the calendar, and recording memories/observations in the same calendar space.


Future Work:

-A display to represent news, communications, current state, and more, in a hierarchical way, so users can both filter out content beyond their space of control, yet incorporating global summaries. 

-Cryptocurrencies to reward good.

-A dating app.

-Work on hyperoperations, flow, addition of complex numbers, visualizing limit distributions of simulated dynamics, animating and visualizing polynomial roots and coefficients and solving equations given a finite sequence of symbols.
